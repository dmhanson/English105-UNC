# English105-UNC
 This is a repository containing [instructional steps](https://github.com/dmhanson/English105-UNC/blob/main/Instructional%20steps.ipynb), and a sample dataset for [Violent crime and homicide rate per county in NC](https://github.com/dmhanson/English105-UNC/blob/main/ViolentCrime-HomicideRate-inNorthCarolina.xls). 

A [Data collection](https://github.com/dmhanson/English105-UNC/tree/main/Data%20collection) folder on the instructional steps to reproduce the data, visual display of the data on a state wide scale and a sample of the full information with a readme on what the collection details.

These materials have been adpated from excellent lessons created by the staff at the [Research Hub](https://library.unc.edu/hub/) of the UNC 's Davis Library.

The repository is to be used for discerening if a County has more violent crime than others and based off that factor, how much homicide is happening in that County. This information was collected from [CountyHealthData_2014-2015.xls](https://github.com/dmhanson/English105-UNC/blob/main/CountyHealthData_2014-2015.xls). 

The purpose of this data is to help individuals wanting to move to North Carolina or people wanting to relocate in North Carolina select Counties in which crime is lower in the part of the State they are wanting to live in. It provides the initial steps on taking statisical data to formulate a decision based on information and not opinion. This repository and the steps for pulling this data gives only one outlook on which county to live in.

If they are trying to relocate to the western portion of NC, they can look at the Counties in that area to discern which one has the lowest Violent crime to begin house hunting. This can also be done to other areas of data inside of the CSV file. They can switch the data to not cover violent crime and homicide rate but to see the average income in the area is compared to medical coverage. This allows for more decision making to be placed into which county is the best fit for where to move to.
