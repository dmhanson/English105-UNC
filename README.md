# English105-UNC
 This is a repository containing [instructional steps](https://github.com/dmhanson/English105-UNC/blob/main/Instructional%20steps.ipynb), and a sample dataset for [Violent crime and homicide rate per county in NC](https://github.com/dmhanson/English105-UNC/blob/main/ViolentCrime-HomicideRate-inNorthCarolina.xls). 

The repository contains a Data Analysis folder containing:
1. module on covering [basic topics](https://github.com/dmhanson/English105-UNC/blob/main/Data%20analysis/Python%20Basics.ipynb) in coding Python3
2. module [getting started](https://github.com/dmhanson/English105-UNC/blob/main/Data%20analysis/Using%20Pandas1.ipynb) with the Pandas package
3. module on [using the Pandas package](https://github.com/dmhanson/English105-UNC/blob/main/Data%20analysis/Using%20Pandas2.ipynb) for data analysis

These materials have been adpated from excellent lessons created by the staff at the [Research Hub](https://library.unc.edu/hub/) of the UNC 's Davis Library.

The repository is to be used for discerening if a County has more violent crime than others and based off that factor, how much homicide is happening in that County. This information was collected from [CountyHealthData_2014-2015.xls](https://github.com/dmhanson/English105-UNC/blob/main/CountyHealthData_2014-2015.xls). The purpose of this data is to help individuals wanting to move to North Carolina or people wanting to relocate in North Carolina select Counties in which crime is lower in the part of the State they are wanting to live in. If they are trying to relocate to the western portion of NC, they can look at the Counties in that area to discern which one has the lowest Violent crime to begin house hunting.
